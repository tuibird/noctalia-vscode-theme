Sourcecode for a Noctalia VS Code theme that Matugen can hook into. 

The asociated compiled vsix file can be installed via the built in VS Code command ```
code --install-extension <noctalia location>/noctaliatheme-0.0.1.vsix```

Not sure on the logic to trigger this via Colorschemes menu, but this is a starting point.

Should also be able to set the active VS Code theme by edit the VS Code settings json file with ```sed```
