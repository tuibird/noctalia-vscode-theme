Sourcecode for a Noctalia VS Code theme that Matugen can hook into. 

The asociated compiled vsix file can be installed via the built in VS Code command ```bash
code --install-extension ~/Rice/noctaliatheme/noctaliatheme-0.0.1.vsix```

Not sure on the logic to trigger this via Colorschemes menu, but this is a starting point.
